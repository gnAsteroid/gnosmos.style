# gnAsteroid.style-gnosmos

Default style for [gnAsteroid](https://github.com/grepsuzette/gnAsteroid).
The server embeds it, so it's only really useful if you want to fork it.

**Styles** for GNO Asteroid are just a tree:

```
|- img/
|- css/
|- font/
```

# How it works

You can fork this and start changing the styles for your asteroid.

Each asteroid can specify a different style by invoking e.g. 
`gnAsteroid -style-dir /path/to/style -asteroid-dir ~/asteroids/foo`.

`-style-dir` is optional.
