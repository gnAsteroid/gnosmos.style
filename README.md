# gnAsteroid.style-gnosmos

Default style for [gnAsteroid](https://github.com/grepsuzette/gnAsteroid).
It is integrated there as a git submodule.

A **style** for an asteroid is simply a tree like:

```
|- img/
|- css/
|- font/
```

# How it works

Fork this, start changing the styles for your asteroid. Then:

`gnAsteroid -asteroid-dir ~/asteroids/foo -style-dir /path/to/your/style`.

# In progress

A lot of changes are to be expected.
